<Box title="Mandate Overview" eyebrow="Case Study">
  <p>
    A private owner sought to exit a three-asset, last-mile logistics portfolio without running a broad auction. Monthaven was
    engaged to manage an NCNDA-first process with focus on buyers demonstrating operational synergies in the region.

<Box title="Execution" eyebrow="Process">
  <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
    <li>Executed NCNDA within 48 hours across eight pre-qualified buyer relationships.</li>
    <li>Delivered curated data pack and underwriting memo with institutional assumptions within five business days.</li>
    <li>Coordinated site diligence and credit workstreams, achieving a 34-day confirmatory diligence period.</li>
  </ul>

<Box title="Outcome" eyebrow="Result">
  <p>
    Three finalist offers were secured within valuation guidance, and the seller maintained confidentiality with tenants and
    on-site teams until closing. Post-closing feedback confirmed the streamlined process preserved pricing power.
